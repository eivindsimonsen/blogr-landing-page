## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size (This case mobile width: 375px, desktop: 1440px)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Code the design as close as possible to design files provided

### What I learned

I've learnt that for responsive design, using position absolute on several items is a bad idea, and should probably be avoided.
